    Thoughts/Ideas

    Each user could technically create their own chat room but we're handling the base case where there is only
    one chat room.
    
    connection process I am imagining
        
        In this case the user that initiated the chat room would have three processes and anyone connecting
        would have two processes.
        
        user 0 creates the server
        user 0 joins the server as a client
            - has a process to host server
            - process to listen for messages from the server and writes them to the terminal
            - process that listens to the user and transmits the messages/commands to the server
        user 1 joins the server as a client
            - process to listens for messages from the server and writes them to the terminal
            - process that listens to the user and transmits the messages/commands to the server
        user 2 joins the server as a client
            - process to listens for messages from the server and writes them to the terminal
            - process to that listens to the user and transmits the message/commands to the server

    When the server gets gains or loses a connection it should output a message to everyone.

    Process that's listening will look for particular words that would indicate that something important happened
    that would require an action on its part:
        - a user exited the chat
            - process would have to add the user to its local list of connections
        - a user entered the chat
            - process would have to remove the user from its local list of connections

    - When users connect should they have to check if the chat room exists already?
    
    - What happens if you have two servers listening to the same port? 
    
    - Would they both get the message?
    
    - Would it detect that there is already a process running on that port?
    
    - Would the user who initiated the chat room have a different ip address for each of the processes?
    
    - Would it be the same?
